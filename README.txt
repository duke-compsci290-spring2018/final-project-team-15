Bugs: none known
Thoughts: We had a great time working on this App together. It was much more fun to be able to work on something we were both interested in, and be able to create an app from a simple idea to an actual implementation.
What makes it useful: Our application is very useful for creating a community of people with similar interests. By bringing together everyone who is interested in similar topic (finance and investing) we create an environemnt where users can not only compete with one another, but learn from one another as they can view the profiles of other competiting users and even message them. Our application provides a way for people to learn about investing, which is a very important thing to know about your adult life, without having to risk any of your own money. Thus it is a perfect app for not only those who are already passionate about investing, but also those who want to learn more.

Framework Used: Node
--Pros:
----We decided to use Node.js adn Vue because of it is usefulness in designing web applications. Node makes it super easy to handle different asynchronous events in JavaScript Runtime, and our App has a heavy focus on displaying and manipulating data, all at different times and in differnet ways. Node and View also make it very easy to add components, which make dividing the code between different files based on functionality and different authors when we had to work individually easy and efficient. We decided to use firebase because we want our data to be persistant for users across the world..
--Cons: 
----We initially had a hard time working with Firebase, because of the many asynchronous calls between retrieving data from the external API calls, and retrieving our own data from firebase, we often ran into times where we were not able to use the data when we wanted in functions in our App.
